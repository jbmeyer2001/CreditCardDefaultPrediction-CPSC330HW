    "In this homework you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. This mini-project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We plan to grade fairly and leniently. We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "Finally, this style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"a few hours\" (15-20 hours???) is a good guideline for this project . Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and I hope you enjoy it as well. "

    "In this mini project, you will be working on a classification problem of predicting whether a credit card client will default or not. \n",
    "For this problem, you will use [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled \"default.payment.next.month\" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. You may take some ideas and compare your results with [the associated research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719), which is available through [the UBC library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spend some time understanding the problem and what each feature means. You can find this information in the documentation on [the dataset page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). Write a few sentences on your initial thoughts on the problem and the dataset. \n",

    "\n",
    "The PAY_AMT columns by themselves probably don't provide much useful information, however the interaction of PAY_AMT with other columns could be very useful. For example if no payments are made on an account, it could mean someone is about to default if they've been accruing balance, or it could mean they aren't going to default because they haven't bought anything.\n",

The rest are numeric and will require scaling if I use a model other than decision trees."

    "2. two useful summary statistics are:\n",
    " - the mean value of default.payment.next.month indicates that the classes are somewhat imbalanced since only ~22% defaults.\n",
    " - both EDUCATION and MARRIAGE have some zero values which aren't described in the dataset (Marriage shouldn't have 0's) so I assume that means they don't have\n",
    " information on that. I will NaN and impute them later\n",
    " \n",
    "2. I have created plots for two features that show some patterns within the data, and indicate those features are likely to be helpful for the model\n",
    " - the histogram of LIMIT_BAL indicates that someone with a low limit is far more likely to default then someone with a high limit\n",
    " - the histogram of PAY_0 shows that if someone was late by 2 months on the last month, then they are more likely to default than not. However, individuals with -2, -1, and 0 are far\n",
    " more likely not to default\n",
    " \n",
    "3. \n",
    "Based on looking at the data it seems like the PAY_N features have a lot to say, in that people with higher numbers in PAY_N are more likely to default, although it isn't quite that simple because its possible the existance of a positive number says more about the total. For example, multiple -1's followed by a 2 might be more likely to default than someone with consistant 0's. A more complicated model might find a way to do some feature engineering within PAY_N or some relation to PAY_AMT or BILL_AMT but I'm not including it in this model. While these columns could make sense as either ordinal or numeric, I think I will leave them as numeric and scale them like the other numeric columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to look at the BILL_AMT and PAY_AMT features. In an of themselves they probably don't have that much of a say. An example being someone who has a higher limit may have a higher balance than someone who defaults every single month, but they pay it off every single month too. It could also be that the ratio of bill to payment has a say in whether someone defaults or not. This is probably the location that I will focus most of my feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I didn't display the plots that I made for them, It appeared that data such as SEX and AGE did have an affect, but not as strongly as either LIMIT_BAL and PAY_0 did, worth including but probably not a main focus for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\n",
    "When considering the potential confusion matrix for this problem, I am deciding that accuracy is likely not the best metric to assess this data. A dummy classifier would get it right roughly 78% of the time which seems rather high. Instead, I am considering precision and recall, although I will likely want to optimize recall since a false negative is probably worse than a false positive, as it means the bank would assume someone is not going to default when they actually are. I have to set a threshold though, since answering true every time would technically give a precision of 100% but is completely useless, I'll use an RC curve later on to decide this."
