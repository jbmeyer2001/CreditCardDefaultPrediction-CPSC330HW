    "In this homework you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. This mini-project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We plan to grade fairly and leniently. We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "Finally, this style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"a few hours\" (15-20 hours???) is a good guideline for this project . Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and I hope you enjoy it as well. "

    "For this problem, you will use [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled \"default.payment.next.month\" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. You may take some ideas and compare your results with [the associated research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719), which is available through [the UBC library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spend some time understanding the problem and what each feature means. You can find this information in the documentation on [the dataset page on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). Write a few sentences on your initial thoughts on the problem and the dataset. \n",

    "\n",
    "The PAY_AMT columns by themselves probably don't provide much useful information, however the interaction of PAY_AMT with other columns could be very useful. For example if no payments are made on an account, it could mean someone is about to default if they've been accruing balance, or it could mean they aren't going to default because they haven't bought anything.\n",

The rest are numeric and will require scaling if I use a model other than decision trees."

    "2. two useful summary statistics are:\n",
    " - the mean value of default.payment.next.month indicates that the classes are somewhat imbalanced since only ~22% defaults.\n",
    " - both EDUCATION and MARRIAGE have some zero values which aren't described in the dataset (Marriage shouldn't have 0's) so I am assuming those are unknowns. \n",
    " I will replace the 0's with NaN, and impute them\n",
    " \n",
    "2. I have created plots for two features that show some patterns within the data, and indicate those features are likely to be helpful for the model\n",
    " - the histogram of LIMIT_BAL indicates that someone with a low limit is far more likely to default then someone with a high limit\n",
    " - the histogram of PAY_0 shows that if someone was late by 2 months on the last month, then they are more likely to default than not. However, individuals with -2, -1, and 0 are far\n",
    " more likely not to default\n",
    " \n",
    "3. \n",
    "Based on looking at the data it seems like the PAY_N features have a lot to say, in that people with higher numbers in PAY_N are more likely to default, although it isn't quite that simple because its possible the existance of a positive number says more about the total. For example, multiple -1's followed by a 2 might be more likely to default than someone with consistant 0's. A more complicated model might find a way to do some feature engineering within PAY_N or some relation to PAY_AMT or BILL_AMT but I'm not including it in this model. While these columns could make sense as either ordinal or numeric, I think I will leave them as numeric and scale them like the other numeric columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to look at the BILL_AMT and PAY_AMT features. In an of themselves they probably don't have that much of a say. An example being someone who has a higher limit may have a higher balance than someone who defaults every single month, but they pay it off every single month too. It could also be that the ratio of bill to payment has a say in whether someone defaults or not. This is probably the location that I will focus most of my feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I didn't display the plots that I made for them, It appeared that data such as SEX and AGE did have an affect, but not as strongly as either LIMIT_BAL and PAY_0 did, worth including but probably not a main focus for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\n",
    "When considering the potential confusion matrix for this problem, I am deciding that accuracy is likely not the best metric to assess this data. A dummy classifier would get it right roughly 78% of the time which seems rather high. Instead, I am considering precision and recall, although I will likely want to optimize recall since a false negative is probably worse than a false positive, as it means the bank would assume someone is not going to default when they actually are. I have to set a threshold though, since answering true every time would technically give a precision of 100% but is completely useless, I'll use an RC curve later on to decide this."

    "I at first tried with class_weight as the default and I got a recall of only around .25, so really bad considering that I'm looking at recall as my primary scoring metric.\n",
    "However, with class_weights='balanced' the recall is MUCH better, it gets up to around .633. It's also interesting to note that the accuracy went from .81 to .7, so the accuracy is actually worse than the dummy classifier now, but I believe it to be a better model. Furthermore, there really isn't any noticible overfitting going on, the test and the train scores for accuracy, f1, recall, and precision are all roughly equal. The fact that I am at a recall of only .633 and the model continues to get more complex without improving or overfitting leads me to believe that a linear model does not fit my data all that well, so hopefully the non-linear models will work better. I've also considered the standard deviation on the resulting data and it is low enough that the scores are quite trustworthy."

Regardless it would definitely be worth doing more hyperparameter optimization with SVM RBF considering its test recall is on the higher end and it could improve with more optimization. Additionally, it has the best accuracy and a good f1 score, which are nice despite not being the primary metric of evaluation. Fit time and score time, however are very slow for this model. I will probably reduce the number of cross validation splits so the hyperparameter optimization of SVM RBF does not take too long. Reducing the number of features might also help with this.\n",

The accuracy, f1, and precision are also similar to SVM RBF. It would be worth doing hyperparameter optimization on this model as well to see if it can be improved past the linear model. Thankfully, as opposed to SVM RBF, lightGBM is much faster, and takes only slightly longer than the decision tree to fit and score."

The best performing model overall was a LightGBMClassifier with n_estimators=3, max_Depth=2, and feature_fraction=.6. It is interesting to me that, at least with max depth and feature_fraction the model performs best with numbers that corrospond to relatively low complexity.

    "Some of what I see makes sense, and other bits I am confused about. I think it makes a lot of sense that PAY_0 is the most important feature, if someone misses a monthly payment the month before then it would not be surprising at all for them to default. Along these lines, it also makes sense that PAY_2 is also important, for the same reason (despite not being quite as important). Seeing SPENT so high is a little bit confusing to me, since spending a lot does not necessarily mean that someone is going to default, especially if their limit is high. I suppose that SPENT being so high could be because in conjunction with PAY_0 and PAY_2 it is important. I am a little bit surprised that LIMIT_BAL isn't in there though, because spending a lot when having a low limit I would think would contribute. Seeing PAY_6 have such a little weight isn't surprising, I assume it is just a quirk of the data that PAY_6 is there but PAY_3 through PAY_5 isn't. \n",

I actually got a better recall on the test set than I did on the training set, which is a bit surprising as I didn't train the model with those values. The model is not particularly complex, as I've already mentioned, so the fact that it did as well as it did means that it probably generalizes pretty well. I don't think that I had a problem with optimization bias, given the test score that I have. I have displayed two shap plots, which show how the four important features have impacted a couple guesses, one where all four 'agree' so to speak, and one where the model is very unsure because the features 'disagree'"

    "In retrospect, I don't think that I would have used recall as the scoring metric. I assumed that I would be able to get a better score than I did, despite improving upon the DummyClassifiers recall. While I do think that a false negative would be the worst case for the bank considering the data set, having a high accuracy is also important. I would like to have been able to test more with SVM, and done some feature selection with it, since SVM may have benefitted more from removing a couple features. In the future I would try a voting classifier which might improve performance. My final test score for recall was 0.7217659137577002, and the accuracy was 0.6682222222222223, so actually worse than the Dummy Classifier but that isn't unexpected considering I wasn't going for accuracy. The most important features were PAY_0, PAY2 - which are an indication for the previous two months of whether a payment was made on time -  and SPENT, which records the total amount spent over the past 5 months."

    "The biggest takeaway that I've gotten so far is that creating a good machine learning model doesn't really have to do at all with how clever the code is. In a lot of languages and applications this is not necessarily true. In supervised ml (at least that I've seen so far), all of the clever coding has been done, and a model can be created by anyone with an internet connection and 10 or so lines of code. What makes a good machine learning model depends on the resourcefulness, creativeness, background knowledge, and willingness to iterate of the person creating it."
